This compact x-axis translation stage, featuring a side-mounted micrometer screw, offers a straightforward and reasonably precise linear positioning solution. 
The stage has 60x60x22 plate dimensions and 13 mm of travel. The side mounting of the micrometer keeps the overall profile relatively low, which can be advantageous in tight setups. The stage is availabe in both left- and right-side mounted screws. While providing tactile manual control for fine adjustments, the side-mounted design might present slight ergonomic challenges depending on the orientation and accessibility within a larger system. The rigidity and smoothness of travel are generally acceptable for light to medium loads, making it suitable for tasks requiring controlled linear movement in research, alignment, or light industrial applications where motorized control isn't necessary.
The top plate has only few mounting points, but this can be easly alleviated using an adapter plate.
